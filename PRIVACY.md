# 🔐 Privacy Policy  
**Last Updated:** August 1, 2025  

We value your privacy — we're developers, not data dealers. Here's what we (don’t) do with your info.

---

## 1. 📦 What We Collect  

When you use the AI Image Generation Bot, we log **basic metadata** to help it function properly:

- Your Discord **User ID**  
- The **Server ID** and **Channel ID** where you used the bot  
- The **prompt** you sent  
- A timestamp of the request  

No creepy tracking. No ads. No selling your soul to a data broker.

---

## 2. 🎯 Why We Collect It  

This minimal data is used to:

- Process and respond to your image requests  
- Prevent spam, abuse, and bot exploitation  
- Handle blacklisting if someone goes rogue  

We don't collect anything unnecessary. No DMs. No messages. No email. No location.

---

## 3. 🤝 Who We Share It With  

Absolutely no one.  
We don’t share, sell, rent, or leak your data.  
Not with advertisers, third-party APIs, or shadowy organizations (sorry, Illuminati).

---

## 4. 🧹 Data Retention  

Your request logs might be stored temporarily for moderation or performance tracking — but nothing is kept longer than needed.

---

## 5. 🔒 Security  

We use basic security measures (and common sense) to protect logs. But as with anything on the internet — nothing is 100% invincible. If you find a vulnerability, please let us know.

---

## 6. 📬 Contact  

For questions, concerns, or data removal requests:  
- Open a GitHub Issue  
- Or message us via our Discord support server

Thanks for trusting the bot!  
We respect your privacy like we respect good memes — fully and without compromise.
